		<h3><PREAMBLE></h3>

		<p>
			The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clases that are included in the fulll version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as a software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.
